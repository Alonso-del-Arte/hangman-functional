# hangman-functional

This was spun off from the Assorted Exercises project.

## Project description from the training calendar

> Projects will be completed in IntelliJ. You will need to generate a new Java 
> project from scratch to complete these two projects.

"These two projects" refers to Hangman and another one.

## Project description from course modules

Quoting once again:

Reimplement Hangman.
 
### Limitations/differences from before:
 
* No loops are allowed except for the main game loop, which is a single `while`
 loop.
* The art for hangman should be read from a file, this art connotes the state of 
 the game.
* The user should be able to enter their name, where their name and score will 
 be recorded to a file after each game.
* The game will tell the user if they have the high score or not.
* No exceptions are allowed, all exceptions must be caught by the program.
* Add unit testing to your project

End quote.

Java 8 but might switch to Java 11 if necessary. JUnit 5.70.
